# CronQuestions

**CronQuestions**<sup>[[1]](#myfootnote1)</sup> is the largest known Temporal KGQA dataset, clearly stratified into buckets of structural complexity. CronQuestions expands the only known previous dataset by a factor of 340Ã—. This dataset consists of two parts: a KG with temporal annotations, and a set of natural language questions requiring temporal reasoning. Temporal KG was prepared by taking all facts with temporal annotations from the WikiData subset. The QA dataset was generated with a set of templates for temporal reasoning. These were made using the five most frequent relations from our WikiData subset, namely _member of sports team_, _position held_, _award received_, _spouse_, and _employer_.
