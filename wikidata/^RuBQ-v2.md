## RuBQ v2

RuBQ 2.0<sup>[[2]](#myfootnote2)</sup>, the second version of RuBQ, was released in Decemeber 2020. The dataset extension is based on questions obtained through search engine query suggestion services. The dataset doubled in size: RuBQ 2.0 contains 2,910 questions 
along with the answers and SPARQL queries. The dataset was also expanded with machine reading comprehension capabilities: RuBQ 2.0 incorporates answer-bearing paragraphs from Wikipedia for the majority of questions. Thus, 
the dataset is now not only suitable for the evaluation of KBQA, but also can be used to evaluate machine reading comprehension, paragraph retrieval, and end-to-end open-domain question answering. The dataset can be also 
used for experiments in hybrid QA, where KBQA and text-based QA can enrich and complement each other.
