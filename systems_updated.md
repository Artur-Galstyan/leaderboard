In the second stage, they follow the previous methods to rank the candidate queries. predict the query structure of the question and leverage the structure to constrain the generation of the candidate queries and propose a novel graph generation framework to handle the structure prediction task and design an encoder-decoder model to predict the argument of the predetermined operation in each generative step.

NQS facilitates the identification of the desire (or expected output information) and the user-provided input information, and establishing their mutual semantic relationship. At the same time, it is sufficiently adaptive to query paraphrasing. We have empirically evaluated the framework with respect to the syntactic robustness of NQS and semantic accuracy of the SPARQL translator on standard benchmark datasets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Dubey et al.                                                                                                                                                                  |

Inspecific, authors first employ shallow and deep linguistic analysis to transform NL-queriesinto a set of Query Triples with <subject, predict, object> format. Second, they mapeach phrase in Query Triple to the corresponding resource (class, entity, or property)in DBpedia. As a result, Ontology Triples are generated. Thirdly, the SPARQL querieswill be constructed based on Ontology Triple and question type. At last, the generatedSPARQL queries is used to search on the Linked Data, and the best answer can bepicked out through validating and ranking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | He et al.                                                                                                                                                                     |

Since a number of different software components exist that implement different strategies for each of these tasks, it is a major challenge to select and combine the most suitable components into a QA system, given the characteristics of a question. The authors study this optimisation problem and train classifiers, which take features of a question as input and have the goal of optimising the selection of QA components based on those features and devise a greedy algorithm to identify the pipelines that include the suitable components and can effectively answer the given question. We implement this model within Frankenstein, a QA framework able to select QA components and compose QA pipelines. Evaluation results not only suggest that Frankenstein precisely solves the QA optimisation problem but also enables the automatic composition of optimised QA pipelines, which outperform the static Baseline QA pipeline. | Singh et al.                                                                                                                                                                  |

Given candidate query graphs generated from one question, their model embeds the question surface and predicate sequences into a uniform vector space. The main difference between their approach and previous methods is that the authors integrate hidden vectors of various semantic components and encode their interaction as the hidden semantics of the entire query graph. In addition, to cope with different semantic components of a query graph, dependency parsing information is leveraged as a complementary of sentential information for question encoding, which makes the model better align each component to the question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Luo et al.                                                                                                                                                                    |

It was developed by Marek Ciglan at the Institute of Informatics at the Slovak Academy of Sciences. The method relies on query annotation, where parts of the query are labeled with possible mappings to the given knowledge base. The annotations comprise entities and relations, and were generated by means of a gazetteer, in order to expand relations with synonyms, and a Wikifier tool, in order to annotate entities. From those annotations, MHE constructs possible sub-graphs as query interpretation hypotheses and matches them against the entity graph of DBpedia.

In their approach, the student network aims to find the correct answer to the query, while the teacher network tries to learn intermediate supervision signals for improving the reasoning capacity of the student network. The major novelty lies in the design of the teacher network, where we utilize both forward and backward reasoning to enhance the learning of intermediate entity distributions. By considering bidirectional reasoning, the teacher network can produce more reliable intermediate supervision signals, which can alleviate the issue of spurious reasoning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | He et al.                                                                                                                                                                     |

First, we identify entity, relationship, and class names mentioned in a natural language question, and map these to their counterparts in the graph. Then, the confidence scores of these mappings propagate through the graph structure to locate the answer entities. Finally, these are aggregated depending on the identified question type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Vakulenko et al.                                                                                                                                                              |
