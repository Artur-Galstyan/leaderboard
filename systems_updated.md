NQS facilitates the identification of the desire (or expected output information) and the user-provided input information, and establishing their mutual semantic relationship. At the same time, it is sufficiently adaptive to query paraphrasing. We have empirically evaluated the framework with respect to the syntactic robustness of NQS and semantic accuracy of the SPARQL translator on standard benchmark datasets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Dubey et al.                                                                                                                                                                  |

Inspecific, authors first employ shallow and deep linguistic analysis to transform NL-queriesinto a set of Query Triples with <subject, predict, object> format. Second, they mapeach phrase in Query Triple to the corresponding resource (class, entity, or property)in DBpedia. As a result, Ontology Triples are generated. Thirdly, the SPARQL querieswill be constructed based on Ontology Triple and question type. At last, the generatedSPARQL queries is used to search on the Linked Data, and the best answer can bepicked out through validating and ranking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | He et al.                                                                                                                                                                     |
