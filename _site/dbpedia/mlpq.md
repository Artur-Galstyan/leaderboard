# MLPQ 

**MLPQ** is the first Cross-Lingual KGQA dataset over multilingual DBpedia, which contains 300K questions in English, Chinese, and French.
This dataset has three language pairs (English-Chinese, English-French, and Chinese-French), and requires a 2-hop or 3-hop cross-lingual path 
inference to answer each question. **MLPQ** is available in two formats. One is in RDF format, the other is in a custom format similar to the datasets used in [IRN](https://github.com/zmtkeke/IRN/tree/master/PathQuestion).

This dataset can be downloaded via the [link](https://github.com/tan92hl/MLPQ).
