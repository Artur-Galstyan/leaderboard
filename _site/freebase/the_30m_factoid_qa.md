# The 30M Factoid Question-Answer Corpus 

**The 30M Factoid Question-Answer Corpus**<sup>[[1]](#myfootnote1)</sup> is an enormous question answer pair corpus produced by applying a novel neural network architecture on the knowledge base Freebase 
to transduce facts into natural language questions. The produced question answer pairs are evaluated both by human evaluators and using automatic evaluation metrics, including 
well-established machine translation and sentence similarity metrics.
