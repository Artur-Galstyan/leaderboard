# rewordQALD9

**rewordQALD9** is a bilingual benchmark with alternative rewordings of QALD questions, used for the task of Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). It aims to provide manually-curated translations of Italian questions from the QALD9 dataset. It is also used as a testbed for systems' robustness and flexibility in handing a wider range of language variations, possibly including both standard and informal register. In addition, a further enhancement of the resource is the addition of question reformulations to the original QALD9 data. The dataset can be download via [link](https://github.com/msang/rewordQALD9).
