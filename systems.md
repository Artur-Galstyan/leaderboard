In the first stage, they predict the query structure of the question and leverage the structure to constrain the generation of the candidate queries and propose a novel graph generation framework to handle the structure prediction task and design an encoder-decoder model to predict the argument of the predetermined operation in each generative step. In the second stage, they follow the previous methods to rank the candidate queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

NQS facilitates the identification of the desire (or expected output information) and the user-provided input information, and establishing their mutual semantic relationship.

Inspecific, authors first employ shallow and deep linguistic analysis to transform NL-queriesinto a set of Query Triples with <subject, predict, object> format. Second, they mapeach phrase in Query Triple to the corresponding resource (class, entity, or property)in DBpedia. As a result, Ontology Triples are generated. Thirdly, the SPARQL querieswill be constructed based on Ontology Triple and question type. At last, the generatedSPARQL queries is used to search on the Linked Data, and the best answer can bepicked out through validating and ranking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Specifically, an EL system is used to identify entity mentions in the question and link them to the knowledge graph. They combine this with an NMT model that is trained and used to generate template queries with placeholders for entities.

Since a number of different software components exist that implement different strategies for each of these tasks, it is a major challenge to select and combine the most suitable components into a QA system, given the characteristics of a question. The authors study this optimisation problem and train classifiers, which take features of a question as input and have the goal of optimising the selection of QA components based on those features and devise a greedy algorithm to identify the pipelines that include the suitable components and can effectively answer the given question. We implement this model within Frankenstein, a QA framework able to select QA components and compose QA pipelines. Evaluation results not only suggest that Frankenstein precisely solves the QA optimisation problem but also enables the automatic composition of optimised QA pipelines, which outperform the static Baseline QA pipeline. |

The system is built based on an analogical problem solving approach, and is suitable for providing users with comprehensive answers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Given candidate query graphs generated from one question, their model embeds the question surface and predicate sequences into a uniform vector space. The main difference between their approach and previous methods is that the authors integrate hidden vectors of various semantic components and encode their interaction as the hidden semantics of the entire query graph. In addition, to cope with different semantic components of a query graph, dependency parsing information is leveraged as a complementary of sentential information for question encoding, which makes the model better align each component to the question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Memory Networks are learning systems centered around a memory component that can be read and written to, with a particular focus on cases where the relationship between the input and response languages (here natural language) and the storage language (here, the facts from KBs) is performed by embedding all of them in the same vector space. The setting of the simple QA corresponds to the elementary operation of performing a single lookup in the memory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

It was developed by Marek Ciglan at the Institute of Informatics at the Slovak Academy of Sciences. The method relies on query annotation, where parts of the query are labeled with possible mappings to the given knowledge base. The annotations comprise entities and relations, and were generated by means of a gazetteer, in order to expand relations with synonyms, and a Wikifier tool, in order to annotate entities. From those annotations, MHE constructs possible sub-graphs as query interpretation hypotheses and matches them against the entity graph of DBpedia. MHE was the onlyQALD-2 participant that provided answers to alltypes of questions, performing best on string anddate questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

In this way, the query graph can be completed by only one decoding process without Filling operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

In their approach, the student network aims to find the correct answer to the query, while the teacher network tries to learn intermediate supervision signals for improving the reasoning capacity of the student network. The major novelty lies in the design of the teacher network, where we utilize both forward and backward reasoning to enhance the learning of intermediate entity distributions. By considering bidirectional reasoning, the teacher network can produce more reliable intermediate supervision signals, which can alleviate the issue of spurious reasoning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

First, we identify entity, relationship, and class names mentioned in a natural language question, and map these to their counterparts in the graph. Then, the confidence scores of these mappings propagate through the graph structure to locate the answer entities. Finally, these are aggregated depending on the identified question type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Finally, answers can be retrieved by executing the constructed query graph over the knowledge graph.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The framework is able to construct federated queries by using the disambiguated resources and leveraging the link structure underlying the datasets to query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It captures input keywords’ temporal semantics with signal words. In the TLDRet+, authors compile signal words from Saquete et al. (2009), Derczynski and Gaizauskas (2012), and Fry et al. (1993). Moreover, to annotate temporal value of temporal keywords, they adapt TIMEX3 DATE/TIME annotation. As basic information retrieval framework, TLDRet+ uses an efficient and simple keyword-based QA system called BoTLRet (Rahoman & Ichise 2014), which constructs templates that resemble graph-like structure of linked data and subsumes some part of the linked data to generate possible information. In general, a template is a pre-defined structure that holds position holders and accomplishes tasks by setting those holders with task-specific parameters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The player must answer a series of multiple-choice questions posed in natural language by selecting the correct answer among four different choices. The architecture of the virtual player consists of 1) a Question Answering (QA) module, which leverages Wikipedia and DBpedia datasources to retrieve the most relevant passages of text useful to identify the correct answer to a question, 2) an Answer Scoring (AS) module, which assigns a score to each candidate answer according to different criteria based on the passages of text retrieved by the Question Answering module, and 3) a Decision Making (DM) module, which chooses the strategy for playing the game according to specific rules as well as to the scores assigned to the candidate answers.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

There are two challenges involved: recognizing users’ query intention and mapping the involved semantic items against a given knowledge base (KB), which will be in turn assembled into a structured query. In this paper, we propose an efficient pipeline framework to model a user’s query intention as a phrase level dependency DAG which is then instantiated according to a given KB to construct the final structured query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The encoder takes natural question, entities and relation as input, which is initialized  with a 200-dimensional Chinese word embedding trained by https://aclanthology.org/N18-2028/. The decoder is a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) with attention to generate SPARQL queries by incorporating the representation of entities, relations and SPARQL keywords. Therefore the model is believed to be effective in answering multi-type complex questions, such as factual questions, dual intent ques- tions, boolean questions,  etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
