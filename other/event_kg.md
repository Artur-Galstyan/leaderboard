# Event-QA

**Event-QA** is a dataset for answering Event-Centric questions over Knowledge Graphs (KGs), where the target KG is EventKG, a recently proposed Event-Centric KG. 
Please refer to the original [paper](https://eventcqa.l3s.uni-hannover.de/paper.pdf) for the details about the dataset creation process. Current datasets are mostly entity-centric, 
Event-QA is the first Question Answering dataset that focus on events.

The Natural Language questions are manually created through a Query Verbalisation Interface, where for each SPARQL query, the users had to write the question representation. 
The current version of Event-QA contains questions in English, Portuguese and German.

The Event-QA generation pipeline is done by random walk sub-graph traversal.
