# MetaQA 

**MoviE Text Audio QA (MetaQA)**<sup>[[1]](#myfootnote1)</sup> contains more than 400K questions for both single and multi-hop reasoning, and provides more realistic text and audio versions. MetaQA serves as a comprehensive extension of WikiMovies., in English language. Containing 400,000+ in Text, MP3 file format.

According to the original paper, there are three versions of this dataset: Vanilla, NTM and Audio. Vanilla is a composed of original WikiMovies as 1-hop dataset, 21 types of 2-hop questions and 15 types of 3-hop questions. NTM is generated by translating the Vanilla set using machine translation models. Audio subset is generated by  audio datasets with the help of text-to-speech (TTS) system.

If not specified, dataset below refers to Vanilla set of MetaQA.

Note that this dataset is divided into 1-hop, 2-hop and 3-hop in the original paper: [Variational reasoning for question answering with knowledge graph](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.04071.pdf).
