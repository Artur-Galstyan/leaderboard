# ComplexWebQuestions 

**ComplexWebQuestions**<sup>[[1]](#myfootnote1)</sup> is a famous extension of the WebQuestions dataset, introduced to solve the second issue of few complex multi-relational questions in the WebQuestions. 
It is created by adding more constraints and multi-hop relations into the SPARQL queries from WebQuestionsSP, and then automatically generating questions via templates and Amazon Mechanic Turk.
