# TempQuestions 

**TempQuestions**<sup>[[1]](#myfootnote1)</sup> is a new benchmark containing 1,271 questions, that are all temporal in nature, paired with their answers. Most questions require decomposing them into sub-questions, and the questions are of a kind that they would be best evaluated on a combination of structured data and unstructured text sources. This collection is derived by judiciously selecting time-related questions from the Free917, WebQuestions and ComplexQuestions sets, with additional curation and tagging of temporal cues.
