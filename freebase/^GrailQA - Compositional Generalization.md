# GrailQA

**GrailQA** (Strongly Generalizable Question Answering)<sup>[[1]](#myfootnote1)</sup> is a new large-scale, high-quality dataset for question answering on knowledge bases (KBQA) on Freebase with 64,331 questions annotated with both answers and corresponding logical forms in different syntax (i.e., SPARQL, S-expression, etc.). 
It can be used to test three levels of generalization in KBQA: i.i.d., compositional, and zero-shot. Please see the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07743) and check out the [link](https://dki-lab.github.io/GrailQA/) for more details.


Here, the SOTA evaluation results of GrailQA are copied from its original main leaderboard, please check out the [link](https://dki-lab.github.io/GrailQA/) if you want to see more details.
