**simple_questions_freebase**<sup>[[1]](#myfootnote1)</sup> is an created built on a subset of Freebase - FB5M. The dataset is manually created and annotated against Freebase. This dataset consists of a total of 108,442 questions written in natu-al language by human English-speaking annota- tors each paired with a corresponding fact from FB2M that provides the answer and explains it. These questions are randomy shufffled, and seperated by 70% of them (75910) as training set, 10% as validation set (10845), and the remaining 20% as test set.
